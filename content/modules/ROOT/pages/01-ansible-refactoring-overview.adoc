== Refactoring Ansible Modularity, Reuse, and Maintainability


In this workshop we will explore refactoring a good, or at least _decent_, monolithic application deployment playbook into something more modular, easier to maintain, and with simpler and better reusability
We'll start by validating it works before our first pass at simply breaking it into more modular playbooks and separating out the variables.

Moving on we'll identify what if any components would be be better off suited to roles and consider using one or more existing roles from link:https://galaxy.ansible.com[Ansible Galaxy] if appropriate.
Finally we'll turn our attention to the *Postgresql* component and look at how we could move this into an Ansible Collection, and if this makes sense.

A simple multi-tier infrastructure with a load-balancer (HAProxy) acting as a front end to 2 app servers running a flask application using Postgres as its persistance datastore.
