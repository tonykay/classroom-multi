== First Deploy


Now your environment is setup and customized it is time to clone, examine, and run your project repository or _repo_.


=== Simple Multi-Tier Application Overview

The repo contains a simple, monolithic, playbook `main.yml` that deploys a multi-tier application serving both a web site and it's associated API.

The Application comprises 3 main components, or tiers, which can be deployed onto the lab infrastructure. 
There is also a control node to work from.

== First Deploy

In the first deploy we will just deploy the repo, or project, _"as is"_ without making any changes.

[NOTE]
====
In Ansible plays, modules, roles, etc., should ideally do one thing well rather than attempt to be too _broad_.
In our lab repository the primary playbook `main.yml` is comprised of several, functional plays but it's monolithic nature makes it:

* Inflexible - e.g. it is difficult to re-use the database/postgres play on another project
* Poor "separation of concerns" - DevOps teams all working with a single file dealing with different technology areas
* Mixes configuration and code - variables, which may need frequent updating, are embedded in the plays themselves 
====

. Explore the project
+
This project, currently, has a very flat structure and can be explored simply with the `ls` command. 
For much larger projects `tree` is a useful command, particularly with the `-L` command that can be used to limit the directory depth of output. We will use `tree` later.
+

Notice the `ansible.cfg` file.
Whilst executing `ansible` commands from this directory this takes priority over the default `/etc/ansible/cfg`. You can confirm this with `ansible --version`

. Examine your `ansible.cfg`
+

The `ansible --version` command can identify the location of the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html[`ansible.cfg`^] in use.

+

. View the `main.yml`
+
Take your time and page through the `main.yml` noting the multiple plays and their purpose.
The application is actually deployed _backwards_, which is not uncommon, as each layer requires the services of the layer behind.

* Deploy Database Tier (Postgres)
* Deploy Application Tier (Flask)
* Deploy Load Balancer Tier (HAProxy)
* Smoke Test Application end to end

== Deploy the Application

You are now ready to run the playbook and check if it works as expected.
Watch the `ansible-playbook` command's output to follow, and understand, its progress.

. Run the `main.yml` playbook

. Run it again!
+
It is good to validate that the playbook is idempotent and can safely be run multiple times without breaking the installation

== Test your Application is Deployed Correctly

Assuming you got a successful playbook run you should now validate the deployment.
There are a number of tests you can potentially carry out as each server is running at least 1 service:

* `frontend`: http on port 80
* `app-01` and `app-02`: a website/API endpoint on port 8080
* appdb1: Postgres on port 5432

The simplest tests are to call the API endpoint with `curl` and to browse, from your local machine to the website.

. `curl` the HAProxy Load Balancer i`frontend` (the `-s` option for `silent` stops curl from outputting stats to *STDERR*)
+
[source,sh]
 ---
curl -s frontend/api/resources | jq
----
+

... <TRUNCATED OUTPUT>
----
+
NOTE: Your `curl` command called the *HAProxy* Load balancer which in turned called one of the App Servers.
The *Flask* application in turn connected to the *Postgreql* database running on `appdb1`
+

. You application has been exposed on your local machine, on Port 8080, and you can link:http://localhost:8080[browse to it^].


image::ntier-app-browser.png[role="thumb center" width=100%]

. Test the `teardown.yml` playbook and remove the application.
+

Again it is worth watching the output closely and seeing if there are any expected, or unexpected, messages or changes.
As before feel free to run it twice, note how the output changes as the idempotent teardown has nothing to do on the 2nd pass.
In fact you should expect to see `changed=0` in the output of the second pass for all hosts.
